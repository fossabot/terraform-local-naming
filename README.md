## What's a Module?

A Module is a canonical, reusable, best-practices definition for how to run a single piece of infrastructure, such 
as a database or server cluster. Each Module is created using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), and
includes automated tests, examples, and documentation. It is maintained both by the open source community and 
companies that provide commercial support. 

Instead of figuring out the details of how to run a piece of infrastructure from scratch, you can reuse 
existing code that has been proven in production. And instead of maintaining all that infrastructure code yourself, 
you can leverage the work of the Module community to pick up infrastructure improvements through
a version number bump.

## Who maintains this Module?

This Module is maintained by Terraformation. If you're looking for help.

## How do I contribute to this Module?

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/terraformation/terraform-local-naming/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.



## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, 
along with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases). 

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a 
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR, 
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
